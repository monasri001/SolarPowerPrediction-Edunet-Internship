# Solar Power Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Project Title:
**Solar Power Prediction Using Linear Regression**

## Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to predict solar power generation based on historical weather data using linear regression. The prediction of solar power is crucial for optimizing energy distribution and usage, especially in areas where solar energy is a primary source. By using a linear regression model, we aim to create a predictive model that can help in forecasting the power output based on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and solar irradiance.

## Sustainable Green Technology Goal:
This project aligns with the goal of promoting sustainable energy sources by accurately predicting solar power output. The use of predictive models can optimize the deployment of solar energy, reduce reliance on non-renewable energy sources, and help in planning and managing energy distribution efficiently.
