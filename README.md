# Solar Power Output Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Project Title: **Solar Power Prediction Using Linear Regression**

## Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to predict solar power generation based on historical weather data using linear regression. The prediction of solar power is crucial for optimizing energy distribution and usage, especially in areas where solar energy is a primary source. By using a linear regression model, we aim to create a predictive model that can help in forecasting the power output based on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and solar irradiance.

## Sustainable Green Technology Goal:
This project aligns with the goal of promoting sustainable energy sources by accurately predicting solar power output. The use of predictive models can optimize the deployment of solar energy, reduce reliance on non-renewable energy sources, and help in planning and managing energy distribution efficiently.

## How to Achieve:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical weather data including factors like temperature, humidity, and solar irradiance.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset to remove any missing or outlier values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyze the relationships between various features and the target variable (solar power output).
4. **Model Development**: Use linear regression to build a predictive model based on the processed data.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and R-squared.

## Week 1 of Internship Done:

### 1. **Importing Necessary Libraries**:
   In this step, essential libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn` are imported to facilitate data manipulation, visualization, and model building.

### 2. **Loading Dataset and Data Accessing**:
   The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for easy access and manipulation. The dataset includes columns such as temperature, humidity, and solar irradiance, along with the corresponding solar power output.

### 3. **Data Cleaning**:
   The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and detect anomalies in the data to ensure that the analysis is based on accurate and complete information.

### 4. **Data Statistics**:
   Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) are calculated using decribe() and info() to understand the distribution of the dataset and identify potential correlations between the features and the target variable.

### 5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   EDA is performed to visualize the relationships between the independent variables and solar power output using various plots like scatter plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps.

### 6. **Standardization and Normalization**:
   The features are standardized and normalized to ensure that the data is on the same scale before applying the linear regression model, improving the model’s efficiency and accuracy.
